# Eyes
## Moving eyes
Utilzing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this project shows two eyes that follow your mouse cursor. Future iterations may include adding new eyes on mouse click

## How to Run: 
The files can be loaded on local and index.html opened in a web browser. The eyes will follow the cursor on load.

## Roadmap to Future
Future iterations may include adding new eyes on mouse click or different types of stylized eyes and a reset feature
